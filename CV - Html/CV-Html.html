    <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
<ul>
    <p>
        The propensity for learning is one of my strongest traits, I am always eager and willing to learn. 
        I  am accustomed to working as part of a team or unassisted. 
        I thrive on achieving my goals and  meeting deadlines. Working under pressure is not an issue,
         regardless of how stressful the  environment may be. 
          I believe I have the potential to become an asset to
           the team if given the  chance.
